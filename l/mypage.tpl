<h3>This is my custom WHMCS page's content</h3>

<p>I used the code found <a href="https://developers.whmcs.com/advanced/creating-pages/" target="_blank" title="Click here to navigate to WHMCS Support to obtain the code needed for creating a custom page.">here</a>.</p>

<p>I put that code into a file named: </p>

<p><code>mypage.php</code>, which resides in the root directory (where my WHMCS is installed).</p>

<p>Now, I can write HTML into the file named:</p>

<p><code>mypage.tpl</code>, located in the templates/six/ directory. Any HTML I save into that file, will be displayed on my new custom page.</p>
